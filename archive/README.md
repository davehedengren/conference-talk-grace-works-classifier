# Archive Directory

This directory contains files that have been superseded by improved versions or are development artifacts that are no longer needed in the main project structure.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### `original_versions/`
Contains files that have been replaced by improved, enterprise-grade versions during our systematic refactoring process (Weeks 1-5).

### `development_artifacts/`
Contains generated files, exploratory work, and build artifacts that can be recreated as needed.

## 📋 Archived Files

### Original Versions (Superseded)

#### `classifier.py` 
- **Replaced by**: `classifier_production.py`, `classifier_optimized.py`, `classifier_refactored.py`
- **Reason**: Original monolithic implementation replaced by modular, type-safe, production-ready versions
- **Archive Date**: Week 5 cleanup
- **Features improved**: Type safety, structured logging, performance optimization, error handling

#### `streamlit_app.py`
- **Replaced by**: `streamlit_app_typed.py`
- **Reason**: Original implementation replaced by type-safe, modular version with enhanced features
- **Archive Date**: Week 5 cleanup
- **Features improved**: Type hints, caching, modular design, enhanced visualizations

#### `todo.md` (root level)
- **Replaced by**: `code_review/todo.md`
- **Reason**: Moved to organized location with comprehensive tracking and progress documentation
- **Archive Date**: Week 5 cleanup
- **Features improved**: Organization, progress tracking, detailed accomplishments

### Development Artifacts

#### `interactive.ipynb`
- **Type**: Jupyter notebook (163KB)
- **Reason**: Exploratory development work, not part of production application
- **Archive Date**: Week 5 cleanup
- **Note**: Contains experimental analysis and prototyping work

#### `batch_requests.jsonl`
- **Type**: Generated batch API file (65MB)
- **Reason**: Large generated file that can be recreated as needed
- **Archive Date**: Week 5 cleanup
- **Note**: Can be regenerated using `--generate-batch-input` option

#### Coverage Artifacts
- `.coverage`, `coverage.xml`, `htmlcov/`
- **Type**: Test coverage reports and databases
- **Reason**: Generated files that are recreated on each test run
- **Archive Date**: Week 5 cleanup
- **Note**: Current coverage reports are generated fresh with each `pytest --cov` run

## 🔄 Restoration Instructions

### If you need to restore any archived file:

1. **For reference purposes**:
   ```bash
   # View archived file
   cat archive/original_versions/classifier.py
   ```

2. **For temporary restoration**:
   ```bash
   # Copy back to main directory
   cp archive/original_versions/classifier.py ./classifier_legacy.py
   ```

3. **For permanent restoration** (not recommended):
   ```bash
   # Move back (will overwrite current files!)
   mv archive/original_versions/classifier.py ./
   ```

## 💡 Notes

- **All archived files remain accessible** for reference or emergency restoration
- **No functionality has been lost** - all features are available in improved versions
- **Archive preserves project history** while maintaining clean current structure
- **Files can be permanently deleted** in future cleanup if never referenced
